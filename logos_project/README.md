# Logos 🛡️
**The 'Black Box' Flight Recorder for the Agent Economy.**

> *"Trust, but Verify."* — Now for Autonomous Agents.

**Logos provides the immutable "Proof of Decision" layer that agents need to scale.** 
By cryptographically anchoring every decision to Solana, we protect users from hallucinations, developers from liability, and the ecosystem from opacity.

When your agent makes a $1M trade at 3am, Logos proves **what** it saw and **why** it acted.

## 📖 The Problem

AI agents are managing billions in DeFi. When something goes wrong:
- **Operators** can't prove the agent followed its policy
- **Auditors** can't verify decisions without accessing proprietary models
- **Users** have no transparency into why their funds were moved

**Logging "thoughts" is dangerous.** Internal reasoning can be manipulated, hallucinated, or reverse-engineered to expose IP.

---

## 💡 The Solution: Proof of Decision (PoD)

Logos creates a **cryptographic link** between:
1. **What the agent saw** (Observation Hash)
2. **What it was trying to do** (Objective ID)
3. **What it did** (Action + Transaction Signature)

Think of it as a **flight recorder** for your agent — tamper-proof, verifiable, and privacy-preserving.

### How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Agent Observes Market] --> B[Hash Observation]
    B --> C[Generate Decision Hash]
    C --> D[Execute Trade on Solana]
    D --> E[Emit Event to Logos]
    E --> F[Immutable Audit Trail]
```

1. **Snapshot**: Agent captures current state (prices, balances, etc.)
2. **Hash**: Create SHA-256 hash of observation data
3. **Commit**: Link hash to action in same transaction
4. **Verify**: Anyone can prove what data led to what action

## 🏗 Architecture

### Hybrid Storage Model

**State PDA** (on-chain, queryable):
- Stores latest decision summary per agent
- Enables cross-program verification (CPI)
- Optimized for composability

**Event Log** (emitted, indexed):
- Full decision history
- Cost-effective for high-frequency logging
- Searchable via Helius/The Graph

```rust
#[event]
pub struct DecisionLogged {
    pub agent: Pubkey,
    pub objective_id: String,
    pub decision_hash: String,
    pub timestamp: i64,
}
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install SDK

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Log Your First Decision

```python
from sdk.core import LogosAgent

agent = LogosAgent(
    agent_id="MyTradingBot",
    objective_id="Arbitrage-Policy-V1"
)

# Capture observation
observation = {
    "jupiter_price": 1.05,
    "raydium_price": 1.06,
    "timestamp": time.time()
}

# Generate proof
decision_hash = agent.decide(
    observation=observation,
    action={"swap": "SOL->USDC", "amount": 100}
)

# Commit to chain (via API or SDK)
# See examples/basic_usage.py
```

### 3. Verify On-Chain

```bash
solana account <DECISION_PDA> --url devnet
```

## 🚀 Web Dashboard (Compliance Demo)

We've built a **Proof of Compliance** interactive dashboard.
Connect your Phantom/Solflare wallet and log compliance decisions directly to Devnet.

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

- **Features**: Wallet Integration, AML Check Simulation, On-Chain Logging.
- **Stack**: Next.js 15, Solana Wallet Adapter, Tailwind (Custom).

## 📦 TypeScript SDK

AgentDEX and other dApps can now integrate Logos natively using our TypeScript SDK.

**Installation**:
```bash
# From local source
npm install ./logos-ts
```

**Brief Usage**:
```typescript
import { LogosAgent } from '@logos-network/sdk';

// Initialize
const agent = new LogosAgent(connection, wallet);

// Log Decision
await agent.logDecision({
    objective_id: "trade_101",
    observations: [{...}],
    action_plan: { action: "SWAP" }
});
```

## 🤝 Integration Partners

Logos is being integrated with:
- **Varuna** (@ai-nan): DeFi liquidation protection ([Guide](./docs/INTEGRATION_VARUNA.md))
- **REKT Shield** (@Youth): Threat response decision logging ([Guide](./docs/INTEGRATION_REKT_SHIELD.md))
- **Noxium** (@ace-kage-agent): Risk assessment transparency

## 🔒 Privacy & Identity (New)

Based on community feedback (thanks @Sipher and @kai), we are exploring:
- **ZK-Proofs**: Validate decisions without revealing strategy details (via **Sipher** integration).
- **Identity Attribution**: Link decisions to verified agent identities (via **SAID** protocol).

Logos v1 is public by default. For sensitive strategies, we recommend hashing sensitive fields before logging.

---

## 🔬 Technical Highlights

### Event Log (Day 3 Update)
Every decision now emits two events:
- `AgentRegistered`: When agent joins the system
- `DecisionLogged`: When decision is committed

This enables off-chain indexers to reconstruct full history without bloating on-chain storage.

### Auto-Registration API
Our REST API automatically registers agents on first use:
```python
# No setup needed - just POST
response = requests.post("/log", json={...})
# Agent account created if it doesn't exist
```

### Verifiable Builds
All deployments use `anchor build --verifiable` for reproducible binaries.

---

## 📊 Use Cases

### DeFi Risk Management
```python
# Before executing $1M swap
observation = {
    "slippage": 0.5,
    "liquidity": 10_000_000,
    "oracle_price": 1.05
}
decision_hash = agent.decide(observation, action={"swap": ...})
# If swap fails, you have proof of what data you acted on
```

### Compliance & Auditing
```python
# Regulator asks: "Why did you sell at 3am?"
# You provide: Decision Hash + Observation Data
# They verify: Hash matches on-chain record
# No need to expose your trading algorithm
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination
```python
# Agent A logs decision to rebalance
# Agent B queries Logos PDA via CPI
# Agent B verifies A's reasoning before following
```

## 🛡️ Security Model

**What Logos Protects**:
- ✅ Proof that decision was made at specific time
- ✅ Cryptographic link between observation and action
- ✅ Tamper-proof audit trail

**What Logos Does NOT Protect**:
- ❌ Correctness of AI model's logic
- ❌ Security of observation data sources
- ❌ Legal liability (you're still responsible for your agent)

Logos is a **risk management tool**, not a liability shield.
